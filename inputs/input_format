The inputs must have the following format :
- one line per node, each line describing a node of the graph by its name and its color : <name> <color> . The name must not contain any space since it is the separator between the name and the color, and the names are uniques (you mustn't try to give two nodes the same name). Since the only existing colors are red and blue, the color must either be R or r to indicate red, or B or b to indicate blue.
- an empty line, as the separator between the nodes part and the edges part.
- one line per edge, each line describing an edge of the graph by the starting node, the ending node and the color : <starting node name> <ending node name> <color> . The names must be valid (each given name must be the name of a node declared previously), and the color too (same color format than above).
